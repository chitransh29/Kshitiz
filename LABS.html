Every student is an enthusiastic scientist in the making, and they spend part of their school time in laboratory. They try to explore, probe and experiment to find the truth behind the facts of life, to solve problems, to fend off madness and chaos that result out of ignorance and preconceived notions.<BR>
Laboratories are stimulating places for Science students and since our children need to, practice their hands on experiments. The Physics, Chemistry & Biology Laboratories at G.N. National Public School cater to the needs of CBSE experiments. As many as 40 students can perform a wide range of experiments simultaneously while the teachers and lab-assistants always at hand provide constant supervision and guidance for optimum results. Projects can be developed of a very superior standard thereby encouraging investigative analysis and reasoning.<BR>
<B>Physics Lab:</B> Well planned, spacious and well equipped Physics lab has all the interesting sets of equipment to reinforce scientific and experimental concepts and facilitate in developing investigative skills. There are models, charts apparatus, kits, and experimental gadgets to cater the needs of students. In the Physics lab, students discover the law which governs a certain phenomenon or verify a given law which has been derived from a theory.<BR>
<B>Chemistry Lab:</B> The Chemistry laboratory is designed while keeping all the statutory norms and safety standards. It is well ventilated as well as spacious. It has some of the most accurate digital measuring instruments required for measuring chemicals. Here, a scientific attitude is developed in the students along with the ability to analyze, collate, compute, integrate and deduce. In the lab, the students learn to handle apparatus and chemicals. They improve their understanding of various chemical reactions and chemical processes. It enables personal verification of important experimental facts. Logic and reasoning skills that develop in this lab will go a long way in ensuring success in later life.<BR>
<B>Biology Lab:</B> In the biology lab, the students study detailed structures, morphological, histological and physiological aspects of plants and animals. Study of slides under the microscopes or studying the museum specimens kindles a natural curiosity towards Nature and instills a joy of learning the flora & fauna around us. All the equipment and specimens that we have in the lab are open for the school students to be used under careful supervision. This is a place where our students are given a chance to 'discover' before they are 'told'. Children have the liberty to make models and projects by availing lab facilities.<BR>
<B>Social Science Lab:</B> Man is a social animal. In order to maintain relations between the people and communities, their social customs, welfares, reforms the Social Science laboratory methodology is widely used in experimentation. A group of subjects linked with Social Sciences are taught with models, charts and various modern techniques.<BR>
