Astronomy Clubs in schools are the building blocks for preserving that passion and interest amongst students. Providing proper resources and information to the curious minds is the stepping stone in the making of future astronomers and scientists.<br>
Astronomy may be most simply defined as the study of astronomical objects and phenomenon. It is concerned with most domains in Science like physics and Chemistry as well as skills like Navigation. Mathematics is also engraved in the study of astronomy. As such, Astronomy Clubs are a very effective medium to introduce these subjects to students outside of the classroom and maintain an everlasting interest.<br>
Astronomy Clubs are a useful extra-curricular activity in schools not just to promote the interest in astronomy but also to polish other skills.
