         The second branch of GN National Public School is also sucessfully working in KARWAR (KARNATAKA) since its inception.The people of the area have shown their pleasure gratitude because from such a far flung area of gorakhpur we could select their place from establishing a school with a view to share in our experties in the field of education.They are overwhelmed with our aim and objective to spread better education throughout the country.<BR>
          As part of  the expansion of educational services to various parts of the country,the third branch of GN National Public School was opened at Nutan Bazaar in Tripura in January 2015.The students are given the quality education in the same style and pattern as followed in Gorakhpur under the guidance of a hardworking and dedicatedn team of teachers.At present,the school is running in a rented building.We have already purchased land for the construction of school building.The parents are satisfied with the pattern of education in they render their cooperation for the betterment of the school.
