<P>A Fete is a public function, typically held outdoors and organized to raise funds for a charity, including entertainment and the sale of goods and refreshments or we can define it as ,a fête, or fete, is an elaborate festival, party or celebration. In Britain, fêtes are traditional public festivals, held outdoors and organised to raise funds for a charity. They typically include entertainment and the sale of goods and refreshments.</P>

<P>Organizing the fete is an immense degree of responsibility. The GN NATIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOL  fete requires stalls to be set up for the event within one week time. This is a challenging task as we have small groups of students working for each programme.  This required unwavering dedication and focus and we successfully attained our goal. The key, in addition to constant effort, was delegation of work and coordination, not just with each other, but with the representatives from the other school as well. These are useful skills, and despite the challenge, We're glad of having had the opportunity to learn them. After all the work was done, and we could participate in the fete while it was in full swing, seeing all our effort come to fruition along with that of our class-mates, the long hours seemed to pay off. There’s nothing quite like the feeling of completing a voluminous project successfully. We need such experiences to learn - or rather remember - the value of hands-down hard-work and organisation.</p>
   
<p>Our school organises fete as per the norms so laid by the management .It is just like a gigantic fair in which students are totally indulged and learn so many new things like and have many new experiences.They learn the art of leadership,cocordination e.t.c </p>
