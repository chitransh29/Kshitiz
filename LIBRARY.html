India of the 21st Century is characterized by values, systems, attitudes and perspectives which are constantly evaluated and transformed by vibrant and growing electronic communication systems.The habit of reading is nurtured from childhood, which moulds and enriches the growing minds, shapes their nascent values and develops the right perspectives.Reading is timeless and is recognized as an art, capable of transforming.Our Library is enriched with more than 10000 books which give an opportunity to the students to develop their reading habits in every type of field which they will persue in future.<BR>
To inculcate reading habit among the students and foster the ability & desire to read is the fundamental chore of the library of GN NATIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOL,GORAKHPUR.<BR>
Reading is the art of interpreting printed and written words, the most effective process of conscious learning which influences attitudes, morals, beliefs, judgment and action of the young readers.We  strongly believe that good reading habits are source of knowledge.<BR>
