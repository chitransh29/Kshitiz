The School was started with primary classes. Later we opened the Junior Section. After that we got the permission from CBSE to start the Secondary Section in the year 1996. In 1998, CBSE granted us affiliation to upgrade the School upto the Senior Secondary Level for Science, Humanities and Commerce subjects and the classes are going on under the Science stream.<BR> <br>
The aim of the school is to provide proper and best education to the students. The school imparts education in Primary, Secondary and Senior Secondary level with the aid of latest Scientific apparatus and teaching aids under the guidance and control of highly qualified and experienced staff. Computer Education is given from class- I onwards. We help our students to develop their personality on progressive lines <br> with comprehensive  mental outlook and self-confidence based <br> on sound character and good conduct to face the future.
