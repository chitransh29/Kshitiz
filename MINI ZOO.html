Our school have a mini zoo which is open for all classes during school hours. It allows students to closely absorb the habitat of different animals. Our mini zoo have rabbits, parrots, peacocks, fishes, etc.<BR>
Visiting a zoo helps children understand the importance of taking care of the environment as it has a significant impact on the lives and welfare of animals. Zoos also teach families about the importance of conservation and animal care..<BR>
Most zoos offer educational programming including camps that help children become more aware of animal behavior, care and conservation.<BR>
Even if you don’t attend the educational programs, activities or special events, children will still absorb an insane amount of knowledge when visiting a zoo. They will use all of their senses to take in their surroundings and expand their understanding about animals and their environment. They will learn the way an animal smells, the sounds he makes, the way he feels and what he looks like. Zoos offer a true multi-sensory approach to learning!<BR>
